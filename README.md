# MediaPlayer [Current/Incomplete]

The goal of this project is to learn about Audio Programming.

This library will be able to read audio files such as wav and mp3 and commence audio playback by interfacing with hardware.
If possible I would like to investigate how playback can be changed by manipulating the raw bits of audio files (ie changing bit rate, skipping data bits to begin playback at later stages in the file).

Because I am trying to learn about how audio files interact with hardware, I will not be using any external libraries.
